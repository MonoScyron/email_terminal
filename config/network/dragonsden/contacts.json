He's a European Dragon, but tales of his appearance and actions seem to change over the decades. The first guy I sent to gather info never came back, and to be frank I don't wanna fuck with a dragon. There's lots of varying stories from him, but he seems to treat people relatively well. Then again, I'm pretty sure Ueri ended up as his snack, so take that with a grain of salt. - Kilo"
