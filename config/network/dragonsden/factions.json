    "title": "Red Dragon Triad",
    "body": "Not only relegated to Hong Kong, the Red Dragon Triad are the largest triad in the world. For years they fought over Asia with the Yellow Lotus Triad, and now they have shown themselves the victors of this bloody war. Despite their international reach, or perhaps because of it, their presence in Hong Kong is lesser now than before. Operating out of Kwai Tsing, their bite comes from the vast docks of Hong Kong, along with the classical extortion. While unconfirmed, it is also believed they may have ties to one of the Great Dragons, Lung. While not a certain bet, going against the Red Dragons are a bold move no matter how you make it, and few dare risk the wrath of a proper dragon. Still, their sights are currently set elsewhere, and they seem to be focusing on a wholly different place for now: Japan."

    "title": "Black Chrysanthemum",
    "body": "While the lotuses and dragons fought, the Chrysanthemums grew, nourished by the rivers of blood shed in their war. Refugees from both the warring gangs and the mainland after the collapse of China, the Chrysanthemums chose to profit off the war. Organs, cyberware, human trafficking, slavery. Any trade labeled as dirty has at least one outfit dedicated to it, and they seem to have no plans of stopping their vicious spree. Even worse, they name their home the Kowloon Walled City, a accursed and lawless claim they are the only ones who would willingly lay claim to."

    "title": "Ten Thousand Lions",
    "body": "The Ten Thousand Lions are the remnants of the Yellow Lotus, reformed in the shadows only to reappear in full strength. Patching together the new Triad from remnants of the Yellow Lotus, and sewing in metahumans to make up for any holes, they yet again appear to make a name for themselves. Indeed, they have consciously chosen to base themselves out of minority districts and recruit there, with a strong presence in Kwun Tong. That is not their only advantage, as they are also know to pull on the old connections to Wuxing, and while Wuxing themselves have stated there is no relation, the magical artifacts, research, and gear possessed by the lions could most certainly not have been gotten alone."

    "title": "289s",
    "body": "Operating out of the Yau Tsim Mong district, the 289s are better known as the Easy Money Gang by some. More a group of gangs than one unified syndicate, these gangs thrive on money that's made with the least risk. Piracy, Scams, Identity Theft, Gambling, Counterfeiting. Boasts are common, but you don't get high up in the 289s without backing them up. While the gangs as a whole tend to lean towards the technical, a couple of them are purely magic. If you're on their good side, you can get some cheap trinkets or talismans from them, provided you don't get scammed. On their bad side, you'd do best to remember the second rule of shadowrunning: Geek the Mage."

    "title": "Smoke Circle Society",
    "body": "The Smoke Circle Society specialize in drugs, drugs, and drugs. Operating on the southern coast, they profiteer off the shipping district to smuggle all kinds of goods, but mostly drugs, magic or otherwise. Of course, no triad acts with only one crime in mind, and the Smoke Circle are famous for their indulgence in prostitution and trafficking. Worse, they intentionally get people hooked to serve as \"free\" labour, both for physical labour and sexual. Reviled by the underground mileu, they still thrive. Even the most depraved of markets have willing customers."

    "title": "Kim Dragons",
    "body": "The Kim Dragons are the dregs of korean immigration, surviving off of violent crime and brutality. Situated in between Tsim Mong and Kwai Tsing, they thrive on kidnappings and home invasions. A ragtag bunch, they only show any sign of order when their leader is around: Effectively never."

    "title": "Tolo Vory",
    "body": "While the Triads have made attempts to keep the Yakuza and Mafia out in specifics, the Tolo Vory managed to avoid this by retracting into the Northern Reaches. This is now only helped by their connections to both Evo and the Marine, and the pornography and prostitution they deliver is gladly welcomed by the soldiers who have spent long months at sea. Of course, any attempt to expand gets taken care of, but that certainly doesnt mean they stop trying."

    "body": "The Saito Clan hide on Lantau Island, arriving with the Japanese Executives that make their way to Hong Kong. While they haven't yet gotten a proper foundation in Hong Kong, attempts are covertly being made. None have yet to be effective."

    "title": "Lorinni Family",
    "body": "The Italian Mafia fit ill in the streets of Hong Kong, and have made themselves scarce. Attempting to get in on gambling and smuggling, only a few outfits can be found in the city, and nobody wants them there."
